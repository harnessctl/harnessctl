# CVS Mode

Rules for interacting with local version control and remote platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Forgejo).

## Configuration

- Run `env-get` tool for the `CVS_TOOL` variable to determine the local CVS tool and remote platform tools to use:
  - e.g., `CVS_TOOL=git,gh,cvs_github` means you MUST use `git` for local version control, and you can use the `gh` CLI or `cvs_github` MCP tools to interact with the remote host (GitHub).
  - e.g., `CVS_TOOL=jj,glab,cvs_gitlab` means you MUST use `jj` (Jujutsu) for local version control, and `glab` CLI or `cvs_gitlab` MCP tools for the remote host (GitLab).
- Run `env-get` tool for the `ISSUE_TRACKING` variable to determine issue tracking mode.

## Core Directives

1. **Platform Operations:** Use the tools specified in `CVS_TOOL` (like `cvs_github_*`, `gh`, `glab`, etc.) for issues, PRs, and comments on the remote platform.
2. **Local Operations:** ONLY use the primary tool specified in `CVS_TOOL` (like `git` or `jj`) for commits, branching, and pushing.
3. **No Labels:** NEVER manage or use labels for issues/PRs. Rely solely on the emoticon hierarchy defined in the `issue-tracking` skill.
